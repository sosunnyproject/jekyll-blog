# React State vs. Props 개념정리

**At the end, prop and state are.. render()를 위한 input 데이터 들이다.**

Prop   | State
-------|---------|
can be created by Parent or component itself | created in the component (constructor method..), can get initial data from props
--- | keep track of info while rendering components
components should not change props | components itself can create, update, use state
setProps, replaceProps DEPRECATED | setState로 데이터 값 바꿀 수 있음
초기 입력/설정 값을 계속 유지 | 상태가 변화되는 데이터 값
A way of passing data from parent to child | Reserved only for interactivity -- data that changes over time
예) 사용자 이름, 아이디, 고정으로 렌더되는 텍스트들..| 예) 시간, 카운터, 와이파이 상태


#### Changing _props_ and _state_ 비교 차트

| | _props_ | _state_ | 
--- | --- | --- 
Can get initial value from parent Component? | Yes | Yes
Can be changed by parent Component? | Yes | No
Can set default values inside Component?* | Yes | Yes
Can change inside Component? | No | Yes
Can set initial value for child Components? | Yes | Yes
Can change in child Components? | Yes | No

\* Note that both _props_ and _state_ initial values received from parents override default values defined inside a Component.

## Study notes
### :star: React-Router (not react-router-redux)
My demo: https://github.com/poscoict-arvrmr/edit-boilerplate
- Containers folder
- Components folder
- routes.js file

#### When you want to create a new page called xxx

  1. Create xxx.js file on /app/componetnts folder
    - This file should include all the components you want to draw in the page
    - Create xxx.css file (if needed), and import xxx.css inside xxx.js 
  2. Create xxx.js file on /app/containers folder
    - This file makes xxx as a page
    - Should import app/components/xxx.js
  3. Edit routes.js file
    - This file allows the page transition to happen (via hyperlink)
    - make sure you import /app/containers/xxx.js (not from /components folder)
    - Choose the path url names for xxx Page
  4. Make sure you use that xxx url you just defined in 'routes.js' in any other pages, when you want to redirect to xxx page via hyperlink or button..


### :star: Redux
#### Understanding what Redux is..
(thanks to https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f , Udemy, velopert, and more)

Redux is a state container.

State means data.

State is changed by functions.

- Action: information about event :: static information about event that initiates state change
  - Dispatching action (1) --> Update state (2)

- Reducer: When action is dispatched, it is sent to REDUCER
  - Pure function, never mutates the store, returns same output

- Store: 'application state' stored as objects in STORE

#### example (courtesy of Udemy The Complete React: 2nd edition)

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';
    
// ACTION GENERATORS - functions that return action objects
const incrementCount = ({ incrementBy = 1 } = {}) => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  incrementBy
});
const decrementCount = ({ decrementBy = 1 } = {}) => ({
  type: 'DECREMENT',
  decrementBy
});
const setCount = ({ count }) => ({
  type: 'SET',
  count
});

// REDUCERS
// 1. Reducers are pure functions
// 2. Never change state or actiton

const countReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return {
        count: state.count + action.incrementBy
      };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return {
        count: state.count - action.decrementBy
      };
    case 'SET':
      return {
        count: action.count
      };
      default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(countReducer);
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getState());
});

//DISPATCH
store.dispatch(incrementCount({ incrementBy: 5 }))
store.dispatch(incrementCount());
store.dispatch(decrementCount({ decrementBy: 10 }));
store.dispatch(setCount({ count: -100 }));
```


- ACTION GENERATORS: define functions that will be dispatched, declare any data parameters that will be used in each function
- DISPATCH: call the action (that are previously defined w/ ACTION GENERATOR)
- REDUCER: (switch/case/return chunk) see matching ACTION GENERATOR's [type: 'name'] --> REDUCER searches this 'name' within its switch loop --> matching ACTION GENERATOR function is executed --> returns the certain value

<b> DISPATCH ----> (ACTION GENERATORS) ------> REDUCER </b>

UI (user triggers something - mouse or button click) --> Dispatch action --> Reducer --> Store (change the state) --> UI (updates with new state)
